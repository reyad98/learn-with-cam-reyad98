### `What is Photography`

Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing , and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication

### `What we provide you`
Light and Shadow
Light is obviously the most important element in any photograph because of the basic fact that photography itself is about recording light. As a beginner, I often used to wonder why my sharp image isnâ€™t as eye-catching as I supposed it should be.
Backlit Scenes
The source of illumination (the Sun) was behind me in all of the above images. Does that mean shooting against the sun always yields bad images? The answer is NO. Backlit images bring out a different mood.
Color and Tonality
Color is another predominant entity that sets the mood of a photograph. Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow can bring about a happy emotion whereas tones of blue bring about a cold or gloomy feel. In most cases, colors act as a defining factor of the picture itself.
